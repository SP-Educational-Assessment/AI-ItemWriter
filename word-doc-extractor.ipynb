      "The feasibility of child-centered research, as defined in this volume, depends on the research questions, the context, the target population, and the methodologies used. The aim of child-centered research is not only to uncover the full range of needs and abilities to reflect the diversity of populations of interest but also to explore child perspectives that may be different from those of adults. Children are usually involved in second language assessment to investigate their cognitive, attitudinal and behavioural responses during the development of assessments at the pilot/trial/field test/user testing stages. Their voices expressing their experiences and opinions are actively sought by various elicitation methods and some of their suggestions may be taken on board to improve instruments, processes, technologies. In particular, I describe how 10-12 year-old children, both native English speakers and English language learners, were actively involved in the development of the British Council’s new English language test for Young Learners through participation in cog-labs, try-outs and several rounds of user testing. Research methodologies consisted of individual online interviews and face-to-face focus groups to elicit children’s views and ideas which then shaped the content and processes of the final assessment product. Mixed methods data sources and analyses (including, as in our case, participatory research with children) are necessary to ensure triangulation of findings and to achieve useful, multiple measurement of child outcomes that yield results and interpretations endorsed by children themselves.\n",

      "The feasibility of child-centered research, as defined in this volume, depends on a) the research questions, b) the target population, and c) the methodologies used. In my professional and parental experience, child-centered research is less realistic a) in research that addresses questions which are less immediately relevant or rise out of the lives and experiences of children, b) whose target populations are younger age groups, and c) in research with mainly quantitative approaches. However, even these investigations can achieve some elements of child-centeredness. \n",
      "The question is how to achieve the high standards that child-centered research requires? The aim is not only to uncover the full range of needs and abilities and reflect the diversity of populations of interest but also to explore child perspectives that may be different from those of adults. Apart from ethical considerations of using children as participants in research, it is important to a) measure important and relevant child outcomes both directly and indirectly with age-appropriate, as well as culturally and contextually responsive research instruments, b) have representative sampling rather than convenience sampling, and c) design research based on mixed methods, including quantitative and qualitative approaches. Finding the right questions to ask that is of relevance to children’s lives is at least as crucial as answering them. To investigate previously unexplored aspects, initial exploratory research may be used to lead to confirmatory analysis, especially if the measurement instruments or methods are new, and if practical implications are sought. In an exploratory phase, explanations for and treatment of incomplete data, and a close investigation of outliers is as important as the analysis of group characteristics. This way the common risk of using false positive findings as evidence for change may be reduced, and the risk of false negative finding is avoided where some important aspects have not been uncovered. Moreover, mixed methods data sources and analyses (including, if possible, participatory research with and by children) are necessary to ensure triangulation of findings and to achieve useful, multiple measurement of child outcomes.\n",
      "I will be drawing on my experience of being a) on the Technical Advisory/Expert Group for OECD’s International Early Learning and Child Well-being Study (IELS) since its inception in 2015, b) a parent whose children have participated in language research conducted at The University of Cambridge in the Language and Rhythm and Listening to Speech in Children projects, and c) a consultant who has been involved in the test development and validation of the British Council’s new test for Young Learners aged 10-12. I will be outlining possibilities and challenges of child-centeredness that I have encountered in these projects. Among the suggestions for future directions, I will provide examples of best practice from each of these studies. \n",

      "Definitions of child-focused approach to research\n",
      "\n",
      "Children have traditionally been viewed as dependent and vulnerable, under the care and protection of their legal guardians who are responsible for their safety and welfare. This perspective on the status of children mandates that in research that involves them, responsible adults (parents, school principals, teachers) must act as gatekeepers to allow researchers access through a process of informed consent. This process is ensured by Research Ethics Committees, as well as legal requirements of working with this specific population (such as the Disclosure and Barring Service clearance in the UK). The ethical review process also promotes that research is conducted not only on children but also for them with a clear aim to benefit them. However, in this process the role of the child does not have to be explicitly stated. In most research studies on children, their role has been a passive one. Traditionally, children have lacked power and their voices have been underrepresented in research studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) (1989) aimed to help change ‘the way children are viewed and treated – in other words, as human beings with a distinct set of rights instead of passive objects of care and charity’. As a direct consequence, in the 1990s, there was a paradigm shift in thinking about childhood. It is understood that childhood is a social construct which is historically and culturally constructed and constituted through dialogue. This new perspective has viewed children as agents and active co-creators of social worlds (Prout and James, 1990; James and Pout, 2015). This new approach has shifted the positioning of children and teenagers in research and resulted in a drive toward a representation of their voices (Alva et al 2022). It can be argued that not to include children in the consultation about things that affect them only reinforces the status quo and perpetuates their disempowerment. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the drive for protection of children must be balanced by the need to hear their voices. These seemingly conflicting aims are best illustrated in medical law by the notion of emerging capacity of children and teenagers to give consent to their own medical treatment. The NHS website in the UK states: “Children under the age of 16 can consent to their own treatment if they're believed to have enough intelligence, competence and understanding to fully appreciate what's involved in their treatment. This is known as being Gillick competent.” In medicine, protection is evidently prioritised over autonomy in case a young person refuses medical treatment: “If a young person refuses treatment, which may lead to their death or a severe permanent injury, their decision can be overruled by the Court of Protection.”  (accessed 22 March 2023) \n",
      "\n",
      "Medical law takes the key premise of child-centred research, that is, that it is not children’s age, but their relevant developmental characteristics (cognitive, social, emotional, linguistic, metacognitive maturity) must be taken into account in considerations when involving children in decisions that directly affect them. A child’s capacity to engage in decision-making requires the ability to reflect. Since children have limited life experiences, they need to be supported to enable them to understand the risks and benefits of research in order to their ability to reflect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, in research, it is important to consider whether they are mature enough to understand the level of potential risks and benefit of taking part, and their capacity to make decisions about things that directly affect them. If a child does not seem to be fully capable of understanding what they are agreeing to, but still able to express willingness to take part and understand what is expected of them, their ‘assent’ could be accepted but their parents/carers consent must also be sought. Children must be offered the choice to not participate and to withdraw at any point from the research. \n",
      "\n",
      "A recent EU document (EU, 2019) on child-centered approaches across disciplines makes a distinction between child-focused and child-centered research. Child-focused research includes research with children as participants. For research to qualify as child-centered, there must be an explicit focus on children’s varied needs and interests, and they need to be actively involved in the research, with their individual voices heard (EU 2019, p.9, Murray 2019). The paper considers child-centered approaches in social science, education, law and public policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are certainly many examples of exemplary child-focused research. At the University of Cambridge Primary School where my children have participated in studies by researchers from the Cognition and Brian Sciences Unit and Centre for Neuroscience in Education at the Department of Psychology. The Language and Rhythm in Children study was conducted in 2020/2021, part of which involved brain imaging (EEG to record their electrical brain rhythms while they listen to speech, MEG to take a picture of their brain and record the brain’s magnetic patterns while they listen to speech, and MRI magnetic resonance imaging to provide information about the unique structure of the child’s brain, allowing researchers to understand the information from their MEG scans more accurately). “Compared to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), EEG is more affordable, more tolerant to movement, more flexible (it can be used while sleeping, sitting, standing, or laying), and less ethically demanding.” (Hervé 2022). The  was exemplary and providing  was made extremely simple in an online form. The research aims were clearly stated for parents in terms of educational improvement: “Although this research project may not bring any immediate benefits to your child, in due course the information that we obtain will help to improve children's educational experiences and quality of life.”, e.g. to help identify and diagnose developmental dyslexia and developmental language disorders (previously called specific language impairment) and offer remedial treatment. One of the publications that describe the processes and assessment materials used is Mandke et al (2022). With these strong educational implications sought, the use of longitudinal and interventional design is recommended (Goswami 2020). \n",
      "\n",
      "These studies are exemplary in managing the expectations of the child participants and their parents. The child-centeredness of these studies lies in the aim to bring benefits to children and create enjoyable ways of measuring variables of interest, plus researchers always gain the child’s assent to play the ‘games’ which are the assessments. However, given the research questions, it is not feasible to negotiate all aspects of the tasks with children. The Listening to Speech research pilot is an ongoing study with the aim to “develop novel computerised tasks to measure the speech processing skills related to reading”. It would be really interesting to find out about the children’s understanding of the purpose of the research and what they are contributing to, and whether the involvement in research is meaningful for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We ourselves certainly do research that we believe will bring benefits to children and we try and create enjoyable ways of measuring our variables of interest, plus we always gain the child's assent to play our 'games'. But given our research questions, it is not always feasible to negotiate every aspect of our tasks” (Goswami, 27 March 2023, personal communication). \n",
      "\n",
      "This viewpoint shows that it is not always feasible for children to play an equivalent (or even minor) role in the design and conduct of research even if they were to be trained and supported in some aspect or stage of the research process. This is despite the fact that there is evidence of the benefits of including them: active participation in research raises the confidence, motivation, and aspirations of children, increases empathy, communication and cognitive skills, encourages responsibility, allows the child to learn how to make decisions, gain independence and take control (Robinson 2014). Measuring What Matters (OECD 2022, p.46) also talks about “Eudaimonia (psychological “flourishing”), which is often understood as capturing whether people feel that the things they do in life are worthwhile, but can also include self-perceptions of autonomy, capabilities, competence, sense of purpose, locus of control, and other aspects of psychological well-being or flourishing.“ Children and teenagers should think This sounds interesting, I could help – I haven’t been asked yet but hopefully someone will ask me soon, rather than I do not understand, I cannot help, I’m never going to be asked anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, it has been demonstrated that children are capable of reporting on their experiences and are competent to express their views from a very young age (see, for example, Clark, McQuail and Moss 2003, Day 2010). Therefore, it is possible to conduct research in collaboration with them where they are active participants in the research process. For instance, the OECD’s IELS seeks to elicit 5-year-old children’s voices through verbal and visual means as well as through observation and conversation with each individual child. IELS researchers wanted to include a small subset of questions in the study from a wide range of possible question types collected from various sources. The approximate administration time was set at 1-3 minutes. Various question formats were considered and tried out in the field test: a) multiple choice format, b) binary scale, yes/no questions c) self-report using smiley’s, d) picture vignettes with related questions. Finally it was agreed that asking open-ended questions is a great way to get to know about children’s inner world, personal preferences and generally to allow them to show a window into their personality and uniqueness. Engaging children in a short conversation by the test administrator at the end represented a welcome break from the direct assessment protocol.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aim was to integrate children’s own thoughts on what they enjoy and what they want to do or be when they grow up with child outcomes (OECD 2020). The findings from the first round of IELS show a direct relationship between children’s views and perspectives on their lives and their social, cognitive and emotional development. Questions such as “What do you like best about your centre or school?” elicited clear and often very specific responses from almost all five-year-olds. Children were able to reflect on their favourite activity (play; arts and crafts such as drawing, building, construction; learning activity such as handwriting, looking through books (Play, Create and Learn, OECD, 2021, p.3-8). Perhaps not surprisingly, there is a direct relationship between children’s positive views on learning activities and their early learning outcomes, especially in the cognitive domain (emergent literacy, emergent numeracy, working memory and mental flexibility) as well as their social-emotional development. Curiosity and empathy are two traits that mediate these relationships (Caring, Sharing and Daring, OECD 2021, p.6). Another strong finding was that children who said they liked to choose their activity, demonstrating autonomy and independence, had early learning scores that were significantly higher than average, across a range of domains. “Similar to children who state that learning is their preferred activity, children who most like choosing have higher emergent literacy and emergent numeracy than other children. In addition, children who like to choose the activities they undertake also have significantly higher levels of self-regulation, pro-social skills and trust than other children” (Play, Create and Learn OECD 2021, p.13). Children’s career aspirations were also linked to their outcomes: those children who would like to be scientists and engineers had higher emerging oral language skills, and those who would like to work with animals or teach had higher social emotional skills (Future at Five, OECD, 2021, p.11). \n",
      "\n",
      "The children’s responses to these questions added critical information on correlates of cognitive and non-cognitive skills assessed. These topics have large policy and analytical value, as a related study on social and emotional skills among 10-15 year olds (SSES, Beyond Academic Learning, OECD 2021) also shows. In SSES, intellectual curiosity and persistence in efforts are the skills most strongly related to higher school performance for both 10- and 15-year-olds. It is important to continue elicit children and teenagers’ views. Even though these studies measure some aspects of children and teenagers’ learning and educational aspirations, “there is in general a lack of data on children’s understandings of how their actions, behaviours, skills, and abilities may (or may not) impact on their well-being, both now and in the future” (Measuring What Matters, OECD 2021, p.21)\n",
      "\n",
      "IELS has demonstrated that eliciting children’s views and accommodating their preferences is not without methodological difficulties. Adult researchers need to overcome the unsymmetrical power relations, achieve rapport to gain the trust, confidence and cooperation of children, and use techniques that help elicit and interpret their thoughts, such as visual methods, self-report data, vignettes and story-based methods. It is important not just to listen to children, but to listen very closely to hear their views (Murray 2019, Rinaldi 2006) without the reference framework of adult-centred norms and perspectives. Interpreting the results requires caution and sensitivity as well as triangulation where child self-report data compliments other measures (such as direct objective measures, parent or teacher reports) (Measuring What Matters OECD 2021, p.46). Thus, research on, for and with children is difficult but possible, and requires highly skilled, specially trained and experienced professionals. \n",
      "The UN Convention aims to help relocate responsibility to redress the deficit view of children by giving them ways to express their views in any form of communication “either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of the child’s choice.” (). It also requires more qualitative methods including participant and non-participant observations and interviews \n",
      "Children should be allowed to express their views in any format they wish to, through art, visual methods, games, and so on. An excellent review of elicitation methods is offered in the EU (2019, pp.11-14). They list more structured activities designed by adults, such as worksheets, vignettes, diaries, sentence completion, spider diagrams. More traditional qualitative methods, such as observation, interviews and focus groups are also adult-led. Many other participatory techniques have been used, like storytelling, puppets, photovoice, drawing, painting, role play, model-making, collage, games, music, dance, drama, cameras, mapping exercises, child-led tours, blogs, videos, television, radio productions, and digital technologies (Coyne and Carter, 2018:6; Crivello et al., 2009). \n",
      "Researchers striving to conduct child-centred research should consider allowing children to have a choice or some control in how they wish to participate. Do children have a say in how they want to provide their opinion/experience (e.g. with or without parent/teacher, drawing or giving an interview, individually or in focus groups). \n",

      "In test development and validation it is customary to involve learners as one - probably the most important - group of stakeholders (Saville and Milanovic 1992). In these test development studies, learners’ response data and experiences are taken as evidence to help finalise features of the test administration and the content of the tests. In case of negative views, test features may be improved (such as in Brown 1993). User feedback may go largely ignored, usually with the assumption that they reflect only a small minority of test takers’ opinion. \n",
      "\n",
      "In a related set of investigations, after a test is launched and operationalised, learners’ cognition, perceptions, and experiences are taken as crucial evidence for validation of test features. In these studies, learners’ responses (both empirical and attitudinal) are used to secure and evidence buy-in and endorsement of features and acceptance of assessment products (e.g. Brown 1993). \n",
      "\n",
      "There are several ways to alicit ranking or Likert-type responses in developmentally appropriate, child-friendly activities. Sim and Horton (2005) investigated the performance and attitude of 7-8 year old children in computer based versus paper based testing. They asked children to complete a smarty-o-meter (Figure 1). They were given five Smarties (chocolate sweets) and asked to distribute them between the computer and paper based test. This was designed to measure their level of preference of one delivery mode over another as opposed to simply asking them their preference. They were also asked whether they would prefer to use paper based or computer based tests in school to see if this differed to the results from the smarty-o-meter.\n",

The authors asked children to express opinion to statements, using smileys representing a 5-point likert-scale, see Figure 2.

      "Papp and Walczak (2016) belongs to the first type of study (test development). The authors used children’s drawings. In this study boys were found to outperform girls on the CB-delivered version of Cambridge Young Learners Starters, Movers and Flyers tests. The researchers elicited participating children’s views through visual and verbal means, including smileys and drawing. The drawings were classified as positive, negative and neutral. The children’s visual and verbal responses were analysed along the lines of classical content analysis (Morgan, 1997) and constant comparison analysis (Strauss & Corbin, 1998). The qualitative sources of evidence (i.e., testimonials, and verbal and graphical comments) were carefully examined for common themes emerging. They were categorised by the same candidate background variables (i.e., age, gender) that were investigated by the statistical analysis from the questionnaire data. This was done in order to look for confirmation of findings or interpretation of the results, as is conventionally done in a mixed methods design.\n",

      "Drawing as a research technique is practical, time-efficient, and popular with children. It was commonly used around 2018/2019 to elicit how children view their life and imagine the future, e.g. Drawing the Future (OECD, UCL 2018 involving 13k UK primary school children aged 7-11, then in 2019 in NZ with 7,7k NZ primary children aged 7-13), the drawing competition on the 70th anniversary of the NHS (July 2018), World Habitat Day children’s drawing contest (UN 2018), Drawing a Better Future (2021, UNESCO, Venezuela), Drawing the Future of Masculinity (2018), Draw-a-scientist (2018). Drawing has been used to promote a growth mindset in people (not just children), or used as one of the arts forms for therapy to alleviate anxiety and uncertainty related to climate change, war, disease (e.g. Draw the Earth in 2050, a project run by TIME for Kids). Drawing or sketching is actually common practice to generate ideas in architecture, computer science, digital design etc., as Sturdee and Lindley (2019) November 2019 Article No.: 18Pages 1–10:\n",
      "“Creating visual imagery helps us to situate ourselves within unknown worlds, processes, make connections, and find solutions. By exploring drawn ideas for novel technologies, we can examine the implications of their place in the world. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, interpreting drawings requires complex analysis. One of the analytical method is Kelly’s Personal Construct theory (Kelly 1955). Best practice is to confirm children’s meaning in an interview, so the best version of this technique is using a combination of drawing, writing and talking. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lee and Winke (2018:283-284) describe the coding and analysis of visual and verbal data: “We imported the drawings into NVivo as image files and coded them on tone (adapted from Carless & Lam, 2014), that is, whether the drawing appeared to have a negative tone, a neutral tone, or a pos- itive tone (examples are in Figure 1 in the online Supporting Informa- tion). We also coded whether there appeared to be a change in difficulty between the two tests (yes or no). If so, we recorded the direction of that change (e.g., Silver more difficult than Bronze). To analyze the interview data, using NVivo we classified each of the 19 participants’ transcripts on the following inherent features (or at- tributes, the term used by NVivo): age at time of testing, L1, length of English instruction, and length of residence (LoR). All drawings were coded by at least two researchers; we discussed discrepancies until we reached a consensus. We additionally coded all materials from a child as relating to either the Bronze test or the Silver test. We coded the data for preferences (like or dislike) and for a specific section of the test (Parts 1–5 for Bronze; Parts 1–6 for Silver). After those objective coding tasks, we inputted the following themes into NVivo as emer- gent nodes: (a) task unfamiliarity, (b) confusion, and (c) a counterfactual item (the item states something that is not true; the child must recog- nize the statement as false). We coded for these three themes because they reoccurred as the children talked about several different parts of the test. The coding outline is in Table 2. “\n",

Tryout sessions were conducted on Zoom following predesigned protocols using admin notes including roles and responsibilities, consent forms, tryout script, observational sheet. Apart from the student, there was a facilitator, an interpreter (sometimes the parent), and an observer in each tryout session. The prototype test materials were presented on Powerpoint slides that included some animation with shared screen. In some cases children were able to install the application and check their computer for necessary technical settings. Where technical issues arose, some children proved to be more knowledgeable than their parents. Timing of sessions was carefully planned to avoid clashes with children’s other commitments. Sessions were scheduled mainly in late afternoons for the student, some were on weekdays, some on weekends. The interviews were conducted in the child’s L1 and included structured interview questions. \n",

      "Strand 1: Observational sheets\n",
      "\n",
      "An observational protocol (an Excel sheet) was designed to capture behavioural and cognitive data exhibited by children during the tryout as well as their responses. For each student there were two observers who gathered detailed data on student behaviour, facilitator behaviour, student scores and timings. In the interview, student feedback was collected on each task in each module. The interview was conducted in the student’s L1 and student responses were then translated into English.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coding, analysis and interrater reliability\n",
      "All data was recorded and aggregated. An Excel file was created with item scores, task scores, task response, response time (in secs), observers’ comments on what’s working, what’s not working, child interview responses on most/least favourite task, most/least difficult task, most/least fun task, each task in a separate tab, a column for each child. Two analysts agreed on the coding scheme (e.g. “engaged”, “answered quickly”, etc). Each observation was then coded as 1 (YES) and 0 (NO) in each column. Codes were then counted and tallied for each item and task (e.g., Item #1, 5 out of 10 were “engaged”; 3 out of 10 “answered quickly”). Task response time was meticulously gathered during the observations, checked with a timer and re-checked again through the recording. All student data and codes were then aggregated. Item statistics were calculated for dichotomously scored items, descriptive stats were run (percent accuracy, point-biserial correlation). Inter-coder reliability was checked. Both coders coded separately data from 11 participants (46% of total participants). An agreement of 96.42% was reached (700 out of 726 total coding instances)  Limitations were noted, it was clear that findings need to be interpreted with caution due to small sample size (n=25). The administration of the prototype test on a shared screen with the use of a powerpoint meant that students had to give their test responses to the facilitator and did not have control over the test administration. Facilitator behaviour sometimes might have influenced students (rushed, shy children, etc.). There were connectivity and other technical issues. In the interviews students’ answers were sometimes ambiguous and not all students gave full answers.\n",

      "The tryout video recordings were watched again. All student responses to the Orientation questions, objective Listening & Reading items, speaking and writing tasks, and interview questions were accurately transcribed and timings noted down from the Zoom transcriptions. Then coding was agreed on\n",
      "linguistic analysis: TextInspector was used, wordcount, unique wordcount, % CEFR level of response, fluency (word per minute), linguistic elements were coded based on Papp and Rixon (2018)\n",
      "functional analysis: codes were based on O’Sullivan et al (2002), after all relevant CEFR scales were identified, additional codes were added to the list e.g. the communication strategy and competence scales from the CEFR for qualitative aspects of performance.\n",
      "Intercoder reliability was checked on one student’s entire response set. 15% (26/177) of the codes assigned were different between the two coders. All disagreements were discussed and a common agreement was reached, with clarifications added to the coding scheme. Although no universally accepted benchmark regarding the percentage of exact agreement is available (Saldana, 2009), 80% has been proposed as a rule of thumb (McHugh, 2012). The data was colour coded using red for the fewest/lowest/slowest responses, amber for average, and green for most/highest/fastest instances. This helped with estimating timing, target word count and functional coverage. It also helped identify the outliers (potentially those who should have been given an easier or harder task). It also crucially helps identify a typical candidate / performance for purposes (test specs, communications, sample responses)\n",
      "\n",
      "Further limitations were acknowledged: constraints of a shared screen on Zoom meant students could not complete writing tasks by typing their response therefore we were unable to simulate and thus validate this component of test administration during the tryouts.  Students wrote answers on paper that scanned and sent after the tryout sessions. Writing samples could have been subject to modification. \n",

      "Findings\n",
      "Key findings indicate that with some exceptions, overall, discrete items work as expected, most discriminate among students and will facilitate routing. Productive responses were on the whole as expected in terms of key features (use of target functions, length and linguistic complexity). Analysis of response data shows that the test design (multiple stage adaptive test) will allow for the demonstration of students’ ability. However, coverage of CEFR descriptors and analysis of responses indicated that there is a need for more B1-level input to elicit more responses at the higher-levels (B1). \n",
      "\n",
      "Observed student behaviours in the tryouts indicated a general engagement and interest in the test. Students responded to most tasks as expected, although there are indications that instructions will need to be reworked to allow for more natural interaction. Interview data showed that students liked the story line and characters, and that they enjoyed the tasks. No issues of cultural sensitivity arose. Student engagement and interest in the prototype test is a key evidence of the age appropriateness of the test.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main aims of the tryout were achieved, the five statements listed in bullet points above are correct. However, the tryout has provided evidence that was used to further improve the test and its administration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evidence from the Tryout suggested that some tasks needed changing (prompts, graphics, instructions, timings). Findings were used to improve the test and its administration, and included the following points:\n",
      "\n",
      "In some tasks, responses are too short and not of the expected complexity. \n",
      "There is a need for more B1-level input to elicit more responses at the higher-levels (B1). \n",
      "Instructions (wording & timing) to be reworked to allow for more natural interaction. \n",
      "Task timings to be revisited in field test once all necessary instructional elements, e.g. task demos, are added and tasks are rendered on the platform to support interactive responses, e.g. typing written responses.\n",
      "New and interesting tasks seemed to contribute to student engagement. Children liked the video retell; compare pictures and write; map task; and the photo album. They liked to express their opinion, use their imagination, aided by the illustrations and the story line, but would like more animation.\n",
      "The following tasks seemed boring or too easy to children: the gap fill with no pictures and just words; listen and number sentences; read aloud; weather notes writing; and re-order words in email. These tend to be tasks children have done in class.\n",

The children in the sample were from 5 countries (Singapore, China, Italy, Vietnam, US) between the ages of 9-13, with an estimated CEFR level from A1 to B2. There were 7 Mandarin speakers, 3 Italian speakers, 1 Vietnamese speaker, 3 native speakers of English and 1 ESL learner from the US. 4 participants took the lower-level (Pre-A1-A2) trial test (2 from Italy and 2 from China), and 11 took the higher-level (A2-B1) trial test.\n",

      "The coglab sessions were conducted on Zoom and videorecorded for analysis (except for 2 NS of English and one Chinese child). Following each task, a Q&A sequence was conducted during which student feedback was collected on each task. After taking the test, children were interviewed in their L1 through the help of an interpreter. They were asked to state which task they enjoyed most and which task they disliked. This was facilitated by a visual illustration to remind them of all the task types. Asking them to identify the task they most liked and the task they most disliked makes this elicitation method a simplified version of the diamond sorting exercise (Thomas and O’Kane 2000, O’Kane 2008) \n",
      "\n",
      "Just like in the first tryout, all open-ended productive responses were transcribed, coded and analysed according to methods of discourse analysis (functional requirements) and corpus analysis (linguistic features). including task timings. All data were compared with Tryout data. Children’s test taking behaviors were closely observed and queried. \n",
      "\n",
      "When recording, we pinned the window of the test taker to be able to their reactions even when they were not talking.\n",
      "For the reading comprehension task, probing questions were asked if the student answered a question wrong. Example questions: \n",
      "Why did you choose this answer? \n",
      "Which part of the text did you use to answer the question? What was your thinking process?\n",
      "Did you understand the text? Was there everything clear? \n",
      "Do you need more time to read the text? Is it long? \n",
      "For open-ended speaking tasks, if the student used the same sentence structure throughout the task, we asked them the prompt question in a different way. For example, for the “describe the cave” task, ask “what do you see in the picture?” rather than “can you say where things are?” to see if it elicited different language. \n",
      "For writing tasks, we asked the student to read their answers aloud after they finished writing. If the writing is too short or off the topic, we asked them why that was the case. Example questions: \n",
      "Do you understand what you need to do for this task? Can you tell me? \n",
      "Pointing to a picture/text prompt, do you understand this? Is this confusing? \n",
      "\n",
      "Some children needed clarifications and replay suggesting that instructions still needed checking. Some children said it was hard to remember and took notes. This suggested memory limitations needed checking. The findings were instrumental in finalizing the assessment content and processes. Based on the results, some tasks were further revised and cognitive requirements fine-tuned (e.g. in terms of prompts, timings, graphics (size, colour, detail, clarity), instructions, word count of input and expected response, layout, scaffolding in the form of word bank and visual support to free up cognitive space, enabling features such as highlighter, etc.). \n",
      "\n",
      "5. Implications\n",
      "\n",
      "Children’s views were taken into account in the following areas: some more traditional, less popular tasks were dropped (such as the weather report task), the cognitive challenge in some tasks was adjusted. No issues of cultural sensitivity arose. However, some patterns in some of the responses to some tasks revealed potential cultural bias, for instance, there was an avoidance of students instructing a character to clean up his messy room. Some children expressed a view. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are several takeaways from the tryout and the coglabs and the following validation analysis. The cyclical quality checks and reviews by BC and ensuing revisions to the test and delivery platform by MM resulted in useful high quality tryout data. The extensive validation has ensured that the BC have adequate analysis to defend test design choices and are able to clearly communicate these internally and externally. The following points need to be considered in Phase II of test development:\n",
      "\n",
      "Some tasks need changing (prompts, graphics, instructions, timings) \n",
      "The small sample size of the tryout means that key assumptions about (1) timing, (2) working memory, (3) discrete item performance will need to be revisited once data from a larger population sample size is available. \n",
      "Recruitment, administration & incentives will require a small team in the large-scale trialling.\n",
      "Instructions are a key weakness of the current task design. There needs to be careful deliberation of how to combine wrap around resources (demo test, information for stakeholders) with task exemplifiers in the test to facilitate understanding whilst ensuring the test can be completed within 60 minutes. \n",
      "Once the delivery platform is identified, the following will need to be carefully rendered and validated:\n",
      "interactions (expected actions: “listen”, “read”, “read-aloud”, “speak”, “write”, “example”, “ready? start”, “mic”, “timer”, “next” etc., explanations like “speak only when you see the mic turns green.”)\n",
      "model examples (animations)\n",
      "speaking windows (to avoid truncated responses, i.e. students starting early and finishing late).\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the rich data that the tryout and coglabs generated were used for the purpose of assessment scale development and validation and reporting of results.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three tasks were omitted for reasons such as CEFR coverage, timing, discriminatory power. They were replaced by new tasks (e.g. reading MCQ, hypothetical writing)\n",
      "1. cave vs tent with test foci persuading and justifying; \n",
      "2. spot the difference: comparing and contrasting, language produced too simple across all proficiency levels\n",
      "3. weather report with test foci describing and giving advice) – reason no discriminatory power: children’s responses were short and simple and lacked language variety.\n",
      "4. one task prompt revised (describe the cave) to elicit richer language, not discriminating between proficiency levels in terms of language produced,\n",
      "5. one task altered (videolog into audio voice message) \n",
      "6. text in reading task simplified and shortened, options made more straightforward to require less inferencing,\n",
      "7. visuals in writing task revised to foreground key elements (hotel, café, movie theatre in Planet City; fishing, cruising, swimming in Planet Wonderland), word count requirement added as task did not elicit enough language to show proficiency.\n",

After some warm-up activities (solving a large puzzle together), the issues arising out of their responses to the short questionnaire were discussed as a group. Boyden and Ennew (1997)\n",

      "Results:\n",

      "Overall, the children found the technology easy to use and understand. They could read the instructions and found them easy to understand. Instructions are pitched at the right level.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were many written comments about how the test length was too long and that the children were not given sufficient time to complete each task. This is also reflected in the percentages above for rows 2-3. A few commented that the platform was slow and buggy, which did not help the test experience, and made the test feel overly long. \n",
      "\n",
      "Many students struggle with the Speaking and Writing tasks – the output activities. A few mentioned that technical difficulties with their microphones affected their speaking, which caused them to mark Speaking tasks down. \n",

We anticipate a variety of views on this topic.\n",
      "\n",
      "For your reference, below are some examples of conceptualizations of child-focused research that we listed in our original message to you:\n",
      "Child-focused research is rooted in the key articles of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC 1989) emphasizing children’s voices and rights. Such an approach promotes active roles for children (such as research with and by children).\n",
      "Child-focused research must be enjoyable and must benefit children directly (such as by teaching them new skills, allowing them to gain confidence, becoming motivated, etc).\n",
      "Child-focused research must make sure that children fully understand the research and their roles in it, and they can consent to it themselves (in addition to their guardians’ consent) and withdraw at any time.\n",
      "Young children may not understand the research and their role in it\n",
      "Child-focused research is linked to child-centered education (which has a long history going back to Rousseau, Froebel, and Dewey, etc) and accordingly it emphasizes the freedom to choose, autonomy, creativity, dialogue, and democratic relationships between adults and children with a consequence for active roles for children in research.\n",
      "Child-focused research takes children’s relevant developmental characteristics into account (such as cognitive, metacognitive, social, emotional, linguistic, etc) and it attempts to adapt originally adult research tools and simplify research processes.\n",
      "Child-focused approaches to research must be participatory in an emancipatory sense, such as inspired by Freire; such research should be democratic and give a voice to ‘the oppressed’. In such research participatory tools are used/ negotiated with children.\n",
      "Emerging consent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Child-focused approaches to research are respectful of children as equals in a democratic educational context where adults and children explore topics of immediate importance to themselves and the community.\n",
      "Child-focused research must be rooted in children’s lives and experiences rather than the adult’s interests and priorities.  \n",
      "Do children want to be assessed in the first place? What do they think the purpose of assessment should be?\n",
      "\n",
      "direct indications of research methodologies. The series defines “methodologies” as “the ‘how’ of our research endeavors, i.e., principles and practices underlying what we do and how we do it”.  More specifically, \n",

      "The feasibility of child-centered research, as defined in this volume, depends on the research questions, the context, the target population, and the methodologies used. Child-centered research is less realistic in research that addresses questions which are less immediately relevant or rise out of the lives and experiences of children, whose target populations are younger age groups, and in research with mainly quantitative approaches. In any research on children, it is important to a) measure important child outcomes both directly and indirectly with age-appropriate, culturally and contextually responsive research instruments, b) have representative sampling rather than convenience sampling, and c) design research based on mixed methods. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finding the right questions to ask that is of relevance to children’s lives is at least as crucial as answering them. The research must be meaningful to children. \n",

      "Comments from a reviewer:\n",
      "The specific focus of this chapter is not easy to discern, I am afraid.  Could it be revised to make it more explicit?\n",
      " \n",
      "Could the author please specify which novel dimension of these highly debated issues the chapter contributes? (referring to the yellow highlighted part)\n",
      "To investigate previously unexplored aspects, initial exploratory research may be used to lead to confirmatory analysis, especially if the measurement instruments or methods are new, and if practical implications are sought. In an exploratory phase, explanations for and treatment of incomplete data, and a close investigation of outliers is as important as the analysis of group characteristics.\n",
